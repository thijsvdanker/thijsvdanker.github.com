## Introduction
In this post I will do a brief introduction on the [RoyalSlider module](http://www.drupal.org/project/royalslider) for Drupal.
At the end of this post you'll be able to make a slideshow of images that work great on both desktop and all your touch-enabled devices! So lets go and talk about:

* The RoyalSlider plugin
* Setting up the module
* Configuring RoyalSlider
* Using RoyalSlider as an imagefield formatter

XXX Iets over part II?

## The RoyalSlider plugin
RoyalSlider is a great javascript plugin, developed by XXX. It's not free, but it's hard to beat for pricing compared to making it yourself ($12 at the moment of writing). The reason I've chosen to use it for my projects is because of its support for touchscreens. But there's alot more to this plugin than that. Some things I considered as important:

* Great [documentation]() & support.
* Easy to use [api]()
* Preloading images
* Skins
* Support for HTML content
* Support for video content


For a full demonstration of its capabilities can be found on the XXX website.
