#_ About me

My name is Thijs van den Anker and I work and live in Haarlem, The Netherlands.
With Bits 'n Bolts, I provide freelance [Drupal](http://www.drupal.org "Drupal") expertise. That means I can realize all your (webbest)dreams!

I can give feedback on your concepts and design from a technical point of view.
When you're good to go, I can develop the front-end (client facing website) and the backend (Content Management System).

I enjoy working on projects and with people that are drivin, passionate.... ok really, does anyone write on their website that they love working on dull projects that no one cares about?

Give me a call and lets have coffee. I'll tell you all about me that you wan't to know!
